# Transhrimpment Digital Investigation Report

*Generated by automated CLI analysis*

## Executive Summary

This report documents a digital forensic investigation of the "Transhrimpment" supply chain fraud case using verifiable credentials and cryptographic signatures to detect document tampering and identity theft.

## Step 1: Identify Entities

Identifying supply chain entities, gather their addresses, locations and aliases for comparison to supply chain documents:

<summary>❌ Create resolver cache from controllers</summary>

```bash
$ bun src/cli.ts create-resolver-cache --controllers case-studies/transhrimpment/controllers --out case-studies/transhrimpment/resolver-cache.json
```

```

```
Exit code: 1

## Step 2: Document Creation (Credential Issuance)

<details>
<summary>📋 Click to expand document creation details</summary>

Issuing verifiable credentials based on the Transhrimpment supply chain narrative.
This includes 8 legitimate documents and 1 fraudulent certificate of origin.
Each credential is cryptographically signed by the appropriate entity using their private keys and verified against their controller documents.

## Step 4: Fraud Detection Analysis

<details>
<summary>🔍 Click to expand fraud detection analysis</summary>

Demonstrating how verifiable credentials prevent fraud through cryptographic verification and holder binding.

### Scenario 1: Fraudulent Credential Detection

**Issue**: Testing the fraudulent Certificate of Origin created in Step 2, where Shady Distributor Ltd attempted to forge a credential claiming to be from Legit Shrimp Ltd but signed it with their own keys.

**Expected Result**: Verification should fail because the signature doesn't match Legit Shrimp Ltd's authorized keys.


<details>
<summary>❌ Fraudulent Certificate Verification Test</summary>

**Test Command:**
```bash
bun src/cli.ts verify-credential --credential case-studies/transhrimpment/credentials/shady-distributor-fraudulent-origin.json --resolver-cache case-studies/transhrimpment/resolver-cache.json
```

**Test Result:**
```
error: Module not found "src/cli.ts"
```

**❌ UNEXPECTED**: This credential should have failed verification.

</details>

### Scenario 2: Stolen Credential Detection (Holder Binding Failure)

**Issue**: Demonstrating what happens when Shady Distributor Ltd attempts to present the legitimate Certificate of Origin (created in Step 2) that was originally issued by Legit Shrimp Ltd to Honest Importer Ltd.

**Expected Result**: Presentation should fail because Shady Distributor Ltd cannot prove they are the intended holder (cnf.kid mismatch).
