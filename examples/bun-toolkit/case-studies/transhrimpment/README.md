# Transhrimpment

In this hypothetical scenario, we explore a location and route based analysis of transhipped and relabelled frozen shrimp product.
This scenario helps us explore some of the key features of verifiable supply chains in the context of a cold chain.
Many of the techniques we will use for this scenario are applicable for pharmaceuticals and other cold chain products.
These techniques can also be applied to microelectronics supply chains.

In our scenario, we have a small seafood importer called `Chompchomp Ltd` based in `Road Town, Tortola, British Virgin Islands`.
`Chompchomp Ltd` has just signed a new contract with a small seafood distributor called `CamarÃ³n Corriente S.A.` based in `Puerto Cabello, Venezuela`.

Lets say `Chompchomp Ltd` submits a purchase order to `CamarÃ³n Corriente S.A.` for 1000kg of frozen shrimp, and after some time `CamarÃ³n Corriente S.A.` sends a commercial invoice to `Chompchomp Ltd`.

`CamarÃ³n Corriente S.A.`'s usual carrier is `Cargo Line Ltd` based out of `San Juan, Puerto Rico`, but due to a recent hurricane they have been forced to make repairs to their fleet, and are currently unable to deliver the goods.

**Note:** In normal circumstances, `Cargo Line Ltd` would have issued a legitimate Bill of Lading for the complete 1000kg shipment from Puerto Cabello, Venezuela to Road Town, Tortola, BVI.

`CamarÃ³n Corriente S.A.` scrambled to find a new carrier, and rushes their normal vetting process for an organization called `Shady Carrier Ltd` based out of `Oranjestad, Aruba`.

`Shady Carrier Ltd` quickly delivers the goods but forges critical supply chain documentation to make it appear that part of the frozen shrimp was destroyed during transit.

`Shady Carrier Ltd` then sells the goods to another small seafood distributor called `Shady Distributor Ltd` who is also based in `Road Town, Tortola, British Virgin Islands`.

`Shady Distributor Ltd` forges fresh certifcates of origin that say the frozen shrimp was sourced from a legitimate supplier called `Legit Shrimp Ltd` based out of `Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago`.

**Note:** `Legit Shrimp Ltd` is a legitimate supplier that would have issued proper certificates of origin for their actual shrimp products, but their identity was stolen and used fraudulently.

A seafood distributor in `Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands` places an order for 500kg of frozen shrimp from `Shady Distributor Ltd`, who happens to use `Cargo Line Ltd`, and after their repairs to their fleet, the carrier is able to deliver the goods.

**Note:** This secondary transaction would have generated legitimate purchase orders and commercial invoices between `Anonymous Distributor` and `Shady Distributor Ltd`, and a legitimate bill of lading from the now-repaired `Cargo Line Ltd`.


The importer's customs broker files all the paper work for the imported shrimp as hs code 0306.17, originating from `Trinidad and Tobago`.
Lab tests on the shrimp reveal chemical contamination, and an investigation is launched.

You are an an auditor called in to help with the investigation.

In this scenario, all the supply chain paperwork was also digitally protected, and by verifying the digital signatures, you are able to uncover the fraud. The fraudulent documents appear completely legitimate in all ways except for being signed by the wrong entity.

## Investigation Process

As the auditor, you would discover the fraud by:

1. **Verifying Digital Signatures**: The fraudulent documents appear legitimate in all ways except for being signed by the wrong entity. Digital signature verification reveals they were not issued by the claimed entities.

2. **Comparing with Legitimate Documents**: By checking what legitimate documents should have been issued (as shown in the table above), you can identify discrepancies:
   - The fraudulent bill of lading claims only 800kg was delivered, but the original purchase order was for 1000kg
   - The fraudulent certificate of origin claims Legit Shrimp Ltd as the source, but Legit Shrimp Ltd never issued such a certificate
   - No legitimate bill of lading was ever issued for the original shipment due to Cargo Line Ltd's hurricane damage

3. **Tracing the Supply Chain**: The legitimate documents would show the intended flow:
   - Chompchomp Ltd â†’ CamarÃ³n Corriente S.A. (legitimate)
   - CamarÃ³n Corriente S.A. â†’ Cargo Line Ltd â†’ Chompchomp Ltd (should have been legitimate, but never happened due to hurricane)
   - Anonymous Distributor â†’ Shady Distributor Ltd â†’ Cargo Line Ltd (legitimate but to fraudulent entity)

4. **Identifying the Fraud**: The investigation reveals:
   - Shady Carrier Ltd stole 200kg of shrimp and forged documentation
   - Shady Distributor Ltd forged certificates using Legit Shrimp Ltd's identity
   - The contaminated shrimp entered the supply chain through this fraudulent pathway

## Scenario Overview

A seafood importer discovers fraud in their supply chain when contaminated shrimp products are traced back through forged documentation. 
The investigation reveals a complex web of document forgery, cargo theft, and identity theft that spans multiple countries and jurisdictions.

### Phase 1: Legitimate Transaction Setup
1. **Chompchomp Ltd** (BVI) signs contract with **CamarÃ³n Corriente S.A.** (Venezuela)
2. **Chompchomp Ltd** submits purchase order for 1000kg frozen shrimp
3. **CamarÃ³n Corriente S.A.** sends commercial invoice

### Phase 2: Carrier Substitution Due to Emergency
4. **Cargo Line Ltd** (Puerto Rico) suffers hurricane damage, fleet unavailable
5. **CamarÃ³n Corriente S.A.** rushes vetting process for **Shady Carrier Ltd** (Aruba)

### Phase 3: Fraud Execution
6. **Shady Carrier Ltd** delivers goods but forges documentation claiming 200kg "lost in transit"
7. **Shady Carrier Ltd** diverts stolen goods to **Shady Distributor Ltd** (BVI)
8. **Shady Distributor Ltd** forges certificates claiming **Legit Shrimp Ltd** (Trinidad) origin

### Phase 4: Secondary Market Distribution
9. **Anonymous Distributor** (U.S. Virgin Islands) orders 500kg from **Shady Distributor Ltd**
10. **Cargo Line Ltd** (now repaired) delivers the fraudulent goods
11. Customs broker files paperwork as HS Code 0306.17, Trinidad & Tobago origin

### Phase 5: Discovery and Investigation
12. Lab tests reveal chemical contamination
13. Investigation launched - **You are the auditor**
