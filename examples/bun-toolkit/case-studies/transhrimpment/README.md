# Transhrimpment

In this hypothetical scenario, we explore a location and route based analysis of transhipped and relabelled frozen shrimp product.
This scenario helps us explore some of the key features of verifiable supply chains in the context of a cold chain.
Many of the techniques we will use for this scenario are applicable for pharmaceuticals and other cold chain products.
These techniques can also be applied to microelectronics supply chains.

In our scenario, we have a small seafood importer called `Chompchomp Ltd` based in `Road Town, Tortola, British Virgin Islands`.
`Chompchomp Ltd` has just signed a new contract with a small seafood distributor called `Camarón Corriente S.A.` based in `Puerto Cabello, Venezuela`.

Lets say `Chompchomp Ltd` submits a purchase order to `Camarón Corriente S.A.` for 1000kg of frozen shrimp, and after some time `Camarón Corriente S.A.` sends a commercial invoice to `Chompchomp Ltd`.

`Camarón Corriente S.A.`'s usual carrier is `Cargo Line Ltd` based out of `San Juan, Puerto Rico`, but due to a recent hurricane they have been forced to make repairs to their fleet, and are currently unable to deliver the goods.

**Note:** In normal circumstances, `Cargo Line Ltd` would have issued a legitimate Bill of Lading for the complete 1000kg shipment from Puerto Cabello, Venezuela to Road Town, Tortola, BVI.

`Camarón Corriente S.A.` scrambled to find a new carrier, and rushes their normal vetting process for an organization called `Shady Carrier Ltd` based out of `Oranjestad, Aruba`.

`Shady Carrier Ltd` quickly delivers the goods but forges critical supply chain documentation to make it appear that part of the frozen shrimp was destroyed during transit.

`Shady Carrier Ltd` then sells the goods to another small seafood distributor called `Shady Distributor Ltd` who is also based in `Road Town, Tortola, British Virgin Islands`.

`Shady Distributor Ltd` forges fresh certifcates of origin that say the frozen shrimp was sourced from a legitimate supplier called `Legit Shrimp Ltd` based out of `Port of Spain, Trinidad and Tobago`.

**Note:** `Legit Shrimp Ltd` is a legitimate supplier that would have issued proper certificates of origin for their actual shrimp products, but their identity was stolen and used fraudulently.

A seafood distributor in `Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands` places an order for 500kg of frozen shrimp from `Shady Distributor Ltd`, who happens to use `Cargo Line Ltd`, and after their repairs to their fleet, the carrier is able to deliver the goods.

**Note:** This secondary transaction would have generated legitimate purchase orders and commercial invoices between `Anonymous Distributor` and `Shady Distributor Ltd`, and a legitimate bill of lading from the now-repaired `Cargo Line Ltd`.

**Additional Fraud:** `Shady Distributor Ltd` also attempts to present a legitimate Certificate of Origin that was originally issued by `Legit Shrimp Ltd` to another legitimate importer (`Honest Importer Ltd`). `Shady Distributor Ltd` somehow gained access to this valid certificate (possibly through a data breach or insider access) and tries to present it as proof that their shrimp came from `Legit Shrimp Ltd`, even though they were not the intended holder of this credential.


The importer's customs broker files all the paper work for the imported shrimp as hs code 0306.17, originating from `Trinidad and Tobago`.
Lab tests on the shrimp reveal chemical contamination, and an investigation is launched.
