## Investigation Summary

### Digital Forensics Results

| Document | Signer | Signature Status | Content Analysis | Fraud Indicator |
|----------|--------|------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Purchase Order** | Chompchomp Ltd | ✅ Valid | 1000kg shrimp ordered | ✅ Legitimate |
| **Commercial Invoice** | Camarón Corriente S.A. | ✅ Valid | 1000kg billed | ✅ Legitimate |
| **Bill of Lading** | Shady Carrier Ltd | ✅ Valid signature | ⚠️ Only 800kg shipped | 🚨 **200kg theft** |
| **Certificate of Origin** | Expected: Legit Shrimp Ltd | ❌ **WRONG SIGNATURE** | Claims legitimate origin | 🚨 **Identity theft/forgery** |
| **Customs Presentation** | Chompchomp Ltd | ✅ Valid presentation | All credentials bundled | ✅ Legitimate customs submission |
| **Fraudulent Presentation** | Shady Carrier Ltd | ❌ **WRONG HOLDER** | Attempted identity theft | 🚨 **Presentation fraud** |

### Key Findings

🎯 **Quantity Fraud**: 200kg of shrimp stolen during transit (1000kg invoiced → 800kg shipped)

🎯 **Document Forgery**: Certificate of Origin forged by Shady Distributor using stolen identity

🎯 **Presentation Fraud**: Shady Carrier attempted to present Chompchomp's credentials to US Customs

🎯 **Chain of Custody Breach**: Fraud occurred at Shady Carrier during transportation

🎯 **Digital Evidence**: Cryptographic signatures mathematically prove:
- Purchase Order and Commercial Invoice are authentic
- Bill of Lading has valid signature but shows quantity theft
- Certificate of Origin is forged (wrong private key used)
- Legitimate presentation verified, fraudulent presentation rejected

### Fraud Detection Method

**Verifiable Credentials + Presentations + Public Key Cryptography = Tamper-Proof Supply Chain**

Each entity's private keys are used to sign documents and presentations, while public keys verify authenticity. The presentation layer adds additional security by ensuring only legitimate holders can present credentials to verifiers like US Customs.

**🔐 Digital forensics using verifiable credentials and presentations successfully exposed the entire fraud scheme and prevented presentation fraud!**
