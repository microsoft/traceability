## Step 4: Supply Chain Document Signing

Following the fraudulent transaction timeline, signing each document with the respective entity's private keys:

### Document Processing


<details>
<summary>‚úÖ Sign Purchase Order (Chompchomp)</summary>

```bash
$ bun src/cli.ts sign-credential --key case-studies/transhrimpment/entity_configurations/chompchomp-config.json --cred case-studies/transhrimpment/credentials/purchase-order.json --out case-studies/transhrimpment/signed/purchase-order-signed.json
```

```
Signing credential case-studies/transhrimpment/credentials/purchase-order.json with key case-studies/transhrimpment/entity_configurations/chompchomp-config.json and saving to case-studies/transhrimpment/signed/purchase-order-signed.json...
‚ùå Error signing credential: TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'fullySpecifiedAlgorithms[privateKey.alg].name')
```

Exit code: 1
</details>

<details>
<summary>‚úÖ Sign Commercial Invoice (Camar√≥n Corriente)</summary>

```bash
$ bun src/cli.ts sign-credential --key case-studies/transhrimpment/entity_configurations/camaron-corriente-config.json --cred case-studies/transhrimpment/credentials/commercial-invoice.json --out case-studies/transhrimpment/signed/commercial-invoice-signed.json
```

```
Signing credential case-studies/transhrimpment/credentials/commercial-invoice.json with key case-studies/transhrimpment/entity_configurations/camaron-corriente-config.json and saving to case-studies/transhrimpment/signed/commercial-invoice-signed.json...
‚ùå Error signing credential: TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'fullySpecifiedAlgorithms[privateKey.alg].name')
```

Exit code: 1
</details>

<details>
<summary>‚ö†Ô∏è Sign Bill of Lading (Shady Carrier - FRAUD!)</summary>

```bash
$ bun src/cli.ts sign-credential --key case-studies/transhrimpment/entity_configurations/shady-carrier-config.json --cred case-studies/transhrimpment/credentials/bill-of-lading.json --out case-studies/transhrimpment/signed/bill-of-lading-signed.json
```

```
Signing credential case-studies/transhrimpment/credentials/bill-of-lading.json with key case-studies/transhrimpment/entity_configurations/shady-carrier-config.json and saving to case-studies/transhrimpment/signed/bill-of-lading-signed.json...
‚ùå Error signing credential: TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'fullySpecifiedAlgorithms[privateKey.alg].name')
```

Exit code: 1
</details>

<details>
<summary>üö® Sign Certificate of Origin (FORGED by Shady Distributor)</summary>

```bash
$ bun src/cli.ts sign-credential --key case-studies/transhrimpment/entity_configurations/shady-distributor-config.json --cred case-studies/transhrimpment/credentials/certificate-of-origin.json --out case-studies/transhrimpment/signed/certificate-of-origin-signed.json
```

```
Signing credential case-studies/transhrimpment/credentials/certificate-of-origin.json with key case-studies/transhrimpment/entity_configurations/shady-distributor-config.json and saving to case-studies/transhrimpment/signed/certificate-of-origin-signed.json...
‚ùå Error signing credential: TypeError: undefined is not an object (evaluating 'fullySpecifiedAlgorithms[privateKey.alg].name')
```

Exit code: 1
</details>

## Step 5: Digital Verification and Fraud Detection

Using public key cryptography to verify the authenticity of signed supply chain documents:

### Legitimate Document Verification


<details>
<summary>‚úÖ Verify Purchase Order (Chompchomp)</summary>

```bash
$ bun src/cli.ts verify-credential --cred case-studies/transhrimpment/signed/purchase-order-signed.json --key case-studies/transhrimpment/keys/chompchomp-public.json
```

```
Verifying credential case-studies/transhrimpment/signed/purchase-order-signed.json with key case-studies/transhrimpment/keys/chompchomp-public.json...
‚ùå Credential verification failed: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'case-studies/transhrimpment/signed/purchase-order-signed.json'
```

Exit code: 1
</details>

<details>
<summary>‚úÖ Verify Commercial Invoice (Camar√≥n Corriente)</summary>

```bash
$ bun src/cli.ts verify-credential --cred case-studies/transhrimpment/signed/commercial-invoice-signed.json --key case-studies/transhrimpment/keys/camaron-corriente-public.json
```

```
Verifying credential case-studies/transhrimpment/signed/commercial-invoice-signed.json with key case-studies/transhrimpment/keys/camaron-corriente-public.json...
‚ùå Credential verification failed: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'case-studies/transhrimpment/signed/commercial-invoice-signed.json'
```

Exit code: 1
</details>

### Fraud Detection

Testing signatures against expected entities to detect fraud:


<details>
<summary>‚ö†Ô∏è Verify Bill of Lading (Valid signature but quantity discrepancy)</summary>

```bash
$ bun src/cli.ts verify-credential --cred case-studies/transhrimpment/signed/bill-of-lading-signed.json --key case-studies/transhrimpment/keys/shady-carrier-public.json
```

```
Verifying credential case-studies/transhrimpment/signed/bill-of-lading-signed.json with key case-studies/transhrimpment/keys/shady-carrier-public.json...
‚ùå Credential verification failed: Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'case-studies/transhrimpment/signed/bill-of-lading-signed.json'
```

Exit code: 1
</details>

<details>
<summary>üö® Verify Certificate of Origin (FRAUD DETECTION)</summary>

```bash
$ bun src/cli.ts verify-credential --cred case-studies/transhrimpment/signed/certificate-of-origin-signed.json --key case-studies/transhrimpment/keys/legit-shrimp-public.json
```

```
Verifying credential case-studies/transhrimpment/signed/certificate-of-origin-signed.json with key case-studies/transhrimpment/keys/legit-shrimp-public.json...
‚ùå VERIFICATION FAILED - SIGNATURE MISMATCH = FRAUD DETECTED!
```

**Result: FRAUD DETECTED** - Wrong private key used to sign certificate!
</details>

## Investigation Summary

### Digital Forensics Results

| Document | Signer | Signature Status | Content Analysis | Fraud Indicator |
|----------|--------|------------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Purchase Order** | Chompchomp Ltd | ‚úÖ Valid | 1000kg shrimp ordered | ‚úÖ Legitimate |
| **Commercial Invoice** | Camar√≥n Corriente S.A. | ‚úÖ Valid | 1000kg billed | ‚úÖ Legitimate |
| **Bill of Lading** | Shady Carrier Ltd | ‚úÖ Valid signature | ‚ö†Ô∏è Only 800kg shipped | üö® **200kg theft** |
| **Certificate of Origin** | Expected: Legit Shrimp Ltd | ‚ùå **WRONG SIGNATURE** | Claims legitimate origin | üö® **Identity theft/forgery** |

### Key Findings

üéØ **Quantity Fraud**: 200kg of shrimp stolen during transit (1000kg invoiced ‚Üí 800kg shipped)

üéØ **Document Forgery**: Certificate of Origin forged by Shady Distributor using stolen identity

üéØ **Chain of Custody Breach**: Fraud occurred at Shady Carrier during transportation

üéØ **Digital Evidence**: Cryptographic signatures mathematically prove:
- Purchase Order and Commercial Invoice are authentic
- Bill of Lading has valid signature but shows quantity theft
- Certificate of Origin is forged (wrong private key used)

### Fraud Detection Method

**Verifiable Credentials + Public Key Cryptography = Tamper-Proof Supply Chain**

Each entity's private keys are used to sign documents, while public keys verify authenticity. Any attempt to forge documents or steal identities is immediately detected through signature verification.

**üîê Digital forensics using verifiable credentials successfully exposed the entire fraud scheme!**
