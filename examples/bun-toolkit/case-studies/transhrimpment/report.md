*Generated by automated CLI analysis*

## Executive Summary

This report documents a digital forensic investigation of the "Transhrimpment" supply chain fraud case using verifiable credentials and cryptographic signatures to detect document tampering and identity theft.

---

## Step 1: Schema Validation

Before processing any supply chain documents, we validate all credential schemas to ensure data integrity:


<details>
<summary>✅ Validate Purchase Order Schema</summary>

```bash
$ bun src/cli.ts validate-schema --schema case-studies/transhrimpment/schemas/purchase-order-credential.yaml
```

```
Validating schema case-studies/transhrimpment/schemas/purchase-order-credential.yaml...
✅ YAML schema is valid
✅ JSON Schema compilation successful

=== Validating built-in examples ===
✅ Built-in example 1 is valid

✅ Schema validation completed successfully
```

Exit code: 0
</details>

<details>
<summary>✅ Validate Commercial Invoice Schema</summary>

```bash
$ bun src/cli.ts validate-schema --schema case-studies/transhrimpment/schemas/commercial-invoice-credential.yaml
```

```
Validating schema case-studies/transhrimpment/schemas/commercial-invoice-credential.yaml...
✅ YAML schema is valid
✅ JSON Schema compilation successful

=== Validating built-in examples ===
✅ Built-in example 1 is valid

✅ Schema validation completed successfully
```

Exit code: 0
</details>

<details>
<summary>✅ Validate Certificate of Origin Schema</summary>

```bash
$ bun src/cli.ts validate-schema --schema case-studies/transhrimpment/schemas/certificate-of-origin-credential.yaml
```

```
Validating schema case-studies/transhrimpment/schemas/certificate-of-origin-credential.yaml...
✅ YAML schema is valid
✅ JSON Schema compilation successful

=== Validating built-in examples ===
✅ Built-in example 1 is valid

✅ Schema validation completed successfully
```

Exit code: 0
</details>

<details>
<summary>✅ Validate Bill of Lading Schema</summary>

```bash
$ bun src/cli.ts validate-schema --schema case-studies/transhrimpment/schemas/bill-of-lading-credential.yaml
```

```
Validating schema case-studies/transhrimpment/schemas/bill-of-lading-credential.yaml...
✅ YAML schema is valid
✅ JSON Schema compilation successful

=== Validating built-in examples ===
✅ Built-in example 1 is valid

✅ Schema validation completed successfully
```

Exit code: 0
</details>

All schemas validated successfully.

## Step 2: Controller Document Generation and Validation

Converting private entity configurations to public controller documents and validating their security:

### Supply Chain Entity Controllers


<details>
<summary>✅ Generate Chompchomp Controller</summary>

```bash
$ bun src/cli.ts generate-controller --config case-studies/transhrimpment/entity_configurations/chompchomp-config.json --out case-studies/transhrimpment/controllers/chompchomp-controller.json
```

```
Generating controller from config case-studies/transhrimpment/entity_configurations/chompchomp-config.json and saving to case-studies/transhrimpment/controllers/chompchomp-controller.json...
✅ Controller saved to case-studies/transhrimpment/controllers/chompchomp-controller.json
```

Exit code: 0
</details>

<details>
<summary>✅ Generate Camarón Corriente Controller</summary>

```bash
$ bun src/cli.ts generate-controller --config case-studies/transhrimpment/entity_configurations/camaron-corriente-config.json --out case-studies/transhrimpment/controllers/camaron-corriente-controller.json
```

```
Generating controller from config case-studies/transhrimpment/entity_configurations/camaron-corriente-config.json and saving to case-studies/transhrimpment/controllers/camaron-corriente-controller.json...
✅ Controller saved to case-studies/transhrimpment/controllers/camaron-corriente-controller.json
```

Exit code: 0
</details>

<details>
<summary>⚠️ Generate Shady Carrier Controller</summary>

```bash
$ bun src/cli.ts generate-controller --config case-studies/transhrimpment/entity_configurations/shady-carrier-config.json --out case-studies/transhrimpment/controllers/shady-carrier-controller.json
```

```
Generating controller from config case-studies/transhrimpment/entity_configurations/shady-carrier-config.json and saving to case-studies/transhrimpment/controllers/shady-carrier-controller.json...
✅ Controller saved to case-studies/transhrimpment/controllers/shady-carrier-controller.json
```

Exit code: 0
</details>

<details>
<summary>✅ Generate Legit Shrimp Controller</summary>

```bash
$ bun src/cli.ts generate-controller --config case-studies/transhrimpment/entity_configurations/legit-shrimp-config.json --out case-studies/transhrimpment/controllers/legit-shrimp-controller.json
```

```
Generating controller from config case-studies/transhrimpment/entity_configurations/legit-shrimp-config.json and saving to case-studies/transhrimpment/controllers/legit-shrimp-controller.json...
✅ Controller saved to case-studies/transhrimpment/controllers/legit-shrimp-controller.json
```

Exit code: 0
</details>

### Controller Document Validation

Validating all generated controller documents for security compliance and structural integrity:


<details>
<summary>✅ Validate Chompchomp Controller (Legitimate)</summary>

```bash
$ bun src/cli.ts validate-controller --controller case-studies/transhrimpment/controllers/chompchomp-controller.json
```

```
Validating controller document case-studies/transhrimpment/controllers/chompchomp-controller.json...
✅ Security check passed - no private keys detected
✅ Controller document structure is valid
✅ Verification method controller references are valid
✅ Method references are valid

✅ Controller document validation completed successfully
```

Exit code: 0
</details>

<details>
<summary>✅ Validate Camarón Corriente Controller (Legitimate)</summary>

```bash
$ bun src/cli.ts validate-controller --controller case-studies/transhrimpment/controllers/camaron-corriente-controller.json
```

```
Validating controller document case-studies/transhrimpment/controllers/camaron-corriente-controller.json...
✅ Security check passed - no private keys detected
✅ Controller document structure is valid
✅ Verification method controller references are valid
✅ Method references are valid

✅ Controller document validation completed successfully
```

Exit code: 0
</details>

<details>
<summary>⚠️ Validate Shady Carrier Controller (Fraudulent Entity)</summary>

```bash
$ bun src/cli.ts validate-controller --controller case-studies/transhrimpment/controllers/shady-carrier-controller.json
```

```
Validating controller document case-studies/transhrimpment/controllers/shady-carrier-controller.json...
✅ Security check passed - no private keys detected
✅ Controller document structure is valid
✅ Verification method controller references are valid
✅ Method references are valid

✅ Controller document validation completed successfully
```

Exit code: 0
</details>

<details>
<summary>✅ Validate Legit Shrimp Controller (Legitimate - Identity Will Be Stolen)</summary>

```bash
$ bun src/cli.ts validate-controller --controller case-studies/transhrimpment/controllers/legit-shrimp-controller.json
```

```
Validating controller document case-studies/transhrimpment/controllers/legit-shrimp-controller.json...
✅ Security check passed - no private keys detected
✅ Controller document structure is valid
✅ Verification method controller references are valid
✅ Method references are valid

✅ Controller document validation completed successfully
```

Exit code: 0
</details>

**Controller Validation Results:**
- ✅ **Security Check**: Verified no private keys are exposed in public controller documents
- ✅ **Schema Compliance**: All controllers follow the W3C Controller Document specification
- ✅ **Key References**: Verification method references are properly structured
- ✅ **SPICE GLUE Identifiers**: Legitimate entities have proper supply chain identifiers
- ⚠️ **Fraud Note**: Shady entities lack legitimate supply chain identifiers (red flag)

## Step 3: Public Key Extraction

Extracting public keys from private entity configurations for signature verification:
